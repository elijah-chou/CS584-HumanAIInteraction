ASSISTANT: Certainly! The human brain is an incredibly complex organ, and it's still not fully understood how it functions. However, we do know that the brain is made up of billions of neurons, which are connected to each other through synapses. When a neuron receives a signal from another neuron, it fires an electrical impulse that travels down its axon. This impulse is then transmitted to other neurons through the synapse, which can either be excitatory or inhibitory. The brain uses these connections to process information, generate thoughts, and control our behavior.
